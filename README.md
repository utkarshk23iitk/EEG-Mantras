   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
   ```

3. **Open the notebook:**  
   Launch Jupyter Notebook and open `Models.ipynb` to explore the code and run experiments.

## Usage

- Place your EEG data files in the `dataset/` directory.
- Use the provided Jupyter notebook (`Models.ipynb`) to:
  - Load and preprocess EEG data
  - Visualize brainwave patterns
  - Train and evaluate machine learning models
  - Experiment with different feature extraction and classification techniques

## Dependencies
